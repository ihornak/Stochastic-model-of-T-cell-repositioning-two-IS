# Stochastic-model-of-T-cell-repositioning

## Introduction

This is the software implementing the models used by the Group of Prof. Heiko Rieger at Saarland University to study the T Cell repolarization during target elimination.

We publish it here to foster good scientific practices, i.e. to facilitate reproduction of our work by interested parties.
